# Mother's Day Carousel - Project Summary

## Overview

The Mother's Day Carousel is a full-stack web application for generating and sharing animated, themed "Happy Mother's Day!" cards using OpenAI's GPT-4 and image generation APIs. It features a responsive, animated React carousel with custom theming and permanent image storage.

## Implemented Features

✅ **Interactive Carousel**: Animated carousel with smooth transitions between themed cards
✅ **AI-Powered Content**: GPT-4.1 for prompt generation and GPT-Image-1/DALL·E 3 for image creation
✅ **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly interface that works on all screen sizes
✅ **Modern UI**: Sleek design with animations using Framer Motion
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors with informative messages
✅ **Custom Theming**: Multiple themes for generating varied Mother's Day cards
✅ **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API operations
✅ **Image Download**: Direct download capability for generated images
✅ **Permanent Storage**: Generated images saved for later access

## Technical Details

### Frontend

The frontend is built with:
- **React 19**: Latest React framework with hooks and functional components
- **Vite**: Modern build tool for fast development
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth UI transitions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive styling
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication

Key frontend components:
- `App.jsx`: Main container with global state and API requests
- `Header.jsx`: Animated title with decorative elements
- `Carousel.jsx`: Interactive carousel with navigation controls
- `Card.jsx`: Card display with loading/error states
- `Footer.jsx`: Branded footer with animations

### Backend

The backend is built with:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web application framework
- **OpenAI SDK**: Interface to GPT-4.1 and image generation APIs
- **File System**: Permanent storage for generated images

Key API endpoints:
- `GET /api/themes`: Returns available themes
- `POST /api/generate-prompt`: Creates a prompt from a theme
- `POST /api/generate-image`: Generates an image from a prompt
- `GET /images/:filename`: Serves static images

### Testing

The application includes:
- **Backend Test Script**: Verifies API functionality
- **Frontend Test UI**: Manual testing of components
- **Theme Validation**: Ensures all themes can generate content
- **Responsive Testing**: Confirms mobile and desktop compatibility
