# Comprehensive Project Requirements & Brief: Mother's Day Carousel AI Card Generator

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to generate and display a carousel of animated, themed "Happy Mother’s Day!" cards. Each card is created using OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 for prompt generation and GPT-Image-1 (with DALL·E 3 fallback) for image creation. The app is visually delightful, highly interactive, and mobile-friendly, with a focus on accessibility, modularity, and maintainability. The project is inspired by creative, nurturing, and artistic roles, and is intended to be both a technical showcase and a heartfelt, personal gift.

## 2. Core Features & Functional Requirements

- **Interactive Carousel:**  
  Users can flip through up to 12 themed, animated Mother's Day cards using left/right arrows or a "Generate" button.
- **AI-Generated Content:**  
  Each card is generated by combining a curated theme (e.g., preschool teacher, author, illustrator, cake designer, children’s picture books, student, artist, mother, etc.) with a creative prompt (via OpenAI GPT-4.1) and an image (via GPT-Image-1, with DALL·E 3 fallback if needed).
- **Custom Themes:**  
  Themes are inspired by the user’s list and additional ideas from the referenced Naz Alibhai website (cake design, teaching, art, children’s books, food, travel, etc.).
- **Animated, Accessible UI:**  
  The UI is visually appealing, animated (using framer-motion or CSS), and accessible (keyboard navigation, alt text, ARIA labels).
- **Prominent Branding:**  
  "LOVE, ZAKI!" is always visible in blue, under the carousel.
- **Animated Header:**  
  A large, animated "Happy Mother’s Day!" message is displayed above the carousel.
- **Responsive & Mobile-First:**  
  The design is fully responsive, with a cream background (#f7eac9), purple text, and blue accents for "ZAKI!".
- **Image Download & Permanent Storage:**  
  Users can download any generated image. All images are saved permanently to disk (e.g., `/server/images/`), accessible via a download endpoint.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Graceful fallback for API errors/timeouts, with user-friendly error messages.
- **Performance:**  
  Optionally cache prompts/images for faster navigation.

## 3. Technical & Architectural Requirements

### Frontend

- **Stack:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Axios
- **Components:**
  - `App`: Main container, manages global state, theme, and layout.
  - `Header`: Animated "Happy Mother’s Day!" message.
  - `Carousel`: Manages image state, navigation, and API calls.
  - `Card`: Displays each themed image and its caption, with download button.
  - `Footer`: Prominent "LOVE, ZAKI!" in blue.
- **Styling:**  
  Tailwind CSS with custom purple, cream, and blue palette; playful, rounded font family.
- **Accessibility:**  
  Keyboard navigation, alt text, ARIA labels, responsive breakpoints.
- **Mobile Compatibility:**  
  All UI elements scale and stack appropriately for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### Backend

- **Stack:** Node.js, Express, OpenAI SDK, dotenv, axios, fs, path, crypto
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/themes`: Returns the list of available themes (from a curated dictionary).
  - `/api/generate-prompt`: Accepts a theme, calls OpenAI GPT-4.1 to generate a creative prompt.
  - `/api/generate-image`: Accepts a prompt, calls GPT-Image-1 (with 60s timeout), falls back to DALL·E 3 if needed, saves image to disk, and returns URLs.
  - `/images/:filename`: Serves static images for download.
- **Security:**  
  API keys stored securely in `.env`, CORS enabled for frontend.
- **Image Storage:**  
  All generated images are saved to a persistent folder (e.g., `/server/images/`), with unique filenames.

---

## 4. Data & State Management

- **Themes Dictionary:**  
  Curated list of up to 12 themes, inspired by user input and the Naz Alibhai website.
- **Carousel State:**  
  Tracks current index, image data, loading/error states.
- **Prompt/Image Caching:**  
  Optionally cache prompts/images in local state or backend for performance.

---

## 5. OpenAI API Integration

- **Prompt Generation:**  
  For each theme, generate a unique, warm, and visually descriptive Mother’s Day card prompt using GPT-4.1.
- **Image Generation:**  
  Use the prompt to generate an image (animated or illustrated style, purple theme, "Happy Mother’s Day!" text).  
  Use GPT-Image-1 with a 60s timeout; if it fails, fallback to DALL·E 3.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Graceful fallback for API errors/timeouts, with clear user feedback.

---

## 6. UI/UX & Animation

- **Header Animation:**  
  Use framer-motion or CSS for animated "Happy Mother’s Day!".
- **Carousel Animation:**  
  Smooth transitions between cards.
- **Accessibility:**  
  Keyboard navigation, alt text, ARIA labels.
- **Styling:**  
  Tailwind for purple/cream/blue palette, rounded corners, playful fonts.

---

## 7. Deployment & Configuration

- **Environment Variables:**  
  API keys, endpoints, image save path, and base image URL are configurable via `.env`.
- **Build & Deploy:**  
  Instructions for local development and deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Nginx, or custom server).
- **Image Directory Permissions:**  
  Ensure the `/server/images/` directory is writable and persistent.

---

## 8. Deliverables

- **Source Code:**  
  All frontend and backend code, modular and well-documented.
- **README:**  
  Comprehensive setup, configuration, and deployment instructions.
- **Theme Dictionary:**  
  JSON or JS file with all curated themes.

- **Prompt/Theme Inspiration:**  
  Continue to reference the Naz Alibhai website for theming and prompt ideas in both backend and frontend.
- **Modularity:**  
  All code must be modular, DRY, and maintainable, with clear, purpose-driven comments.
- **Security:**  
  Secure handling of API keys and environment variables.
